### *Table of contents:*

1. [Laser Cutter]()
2. [3D Printers]()
3. [Soldering Irons]()

### *Disclaimer*

If you are unsure of how a tool work, regardless of whether you have read the instructions and or seen the videos(that might come in the future), **Please do not hesitate** to ask someone who knows how they work and can show you the correct way of operating the tool. You might really want to begin making your project, but it will just take even longer to begin or complete it if anything breaks. Thanks!

**NB** that some of the tools might require supervision from a trained individual. It will be noted if necessary at the given tools.
